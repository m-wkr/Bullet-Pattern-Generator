# Bullet Pattern Generator (2D Fixed Shooter)

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Typescript-blue)

<hr>

This is a recreation of a portion of my 2D "shoot 'em up" NEA, primarily focussed on demonstrating different bullet traversal patterns that are orchestrated by various mathematical functions. This project was motivated to be rewritten in TS after seeing [Oxford's "Can computers be used to create art" challenge](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/college/outreach/python-challenge-1), and the original project was inspired by ZUN's Touhou Project.


## What options are available?

As of v1.0.1, the available bullet patterns include:
- Linear Down
- Linear Left
- Linear Right
- Anticlockwise Rotation
- Rose Curve
- Archimedes' Curve
- Butterfly Curve


## How to Install

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/m-wkr/Bullet-Pattern-Generator`
2. Navigate to its directory `cd Bullet-Pattern-Generator`
3. Install all dependencies `npm install`
4. Run `npm compile run` to compile all Typescript files into Javascript
5. Run `start index.html` for Windows, or `open index.html` in mac/linux

Your installation should be complete, now you can open the index.html file in a browser!
